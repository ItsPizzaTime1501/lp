# Proof

- Proof has to be recorded as soon as possible and cannot end before a run finishes
- Uploading the wrong demo to a run is strictly forbidden. This also means that uploading your partnerâ€™s pov file twice is not allowed as every entry has to be unique
- Admins are allowed to question any runner for proof at any time in case cheating is suspected
- Demo recording is currently the easiest way to determine if someone is cheating or not
