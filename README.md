## Ranking Requirements

- Be in top 5000 on every single player or cooperative map
- A world record tie might be required in case a map has more than 5000 ties
- Overall rankings obviously require both campaigns

## TODO & Ideas

- Remove unused stuff
- Replace CI with unit tests
- Allow video submissions
  - Auth with Steam
- Figure out how SSL/TLS works
